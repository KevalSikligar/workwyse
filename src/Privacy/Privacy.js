                            <p className="data-sec-p">To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.</p>

                            <p className="data-sec-p"><span className="data-title">Request erasure s</span>of your personal data.

Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>

In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
                            <p className="data-sec-p"><span className="data-title">Request restriction of processing</span> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:</p>
